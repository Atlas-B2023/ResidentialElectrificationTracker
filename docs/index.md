## Code Documentation

Public functions are documented on the left. Additional comments for private functions are found through looking at the source code. The `main.py` file is not a part of the scraping library and just serves as a launching point for the GUI application.

## Program usage

A YouTube playlist is being created that walks through how to use the scraping tool. An additional set of videos on how to combine the data collected and import and analyze them in QGIS is being created as well.
